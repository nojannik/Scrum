                <h2>1. Introduction to Scrum</h2>
                <p><strong>Scrum</strong> is a <strong>framework</strong> used to manage and complete complex projects. It's part of the <strong>Agile</strong> methodology, which emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction. Scrum breaks down projects into smaller, manageable pieces, allowing teams to deliver value incrementally and adapt to changes quickly.</p>
                
                <h3>Why Scrum?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Easily adapt to changes in project requirements.</li>
                    <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Foster teamwork and open communication.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Keep everyone informed about project progress.</li>
                    <li><strong>Continuous Improvement:</strong> Regularly assess and enhance processes.</li>
                </ul>

            <section id="key-concepts" class="tab-section">
                <h2>2. Key Scrum Concepts</h2>
                <p>Understanding the foundational elements of Scrum is essential. Let's explore <strong>Epics</strong>, <strong>User Stories</strong>, <strong>Tasks</strong>, and <strong>Bugs</strong> in simple terms with real-world examples.</p>
                
                <h3>Epic</h3>
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> An <strong>Epic</strong> is a <strong>large body of work</strong> that can be broken down into smaller tasks or stories. It represents a significant feature or requirement that delivers substantial value to the user.</p>
                <p><strong>Real-World Example:</strong>  
                In the Tuff8 Shopify project, an Epic could be <em>"Develop the Homepage Design."</em> This is a broad goal that encompasses various design elements and functionalities.</p>
                
                <h3>User Story</h3>
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A <strong>User Story</strong> is a <strong>smaller, specific requirement</strong> written from the perspective of the end-user. It focuses on what the user wants to achieve and why.</p>
                <p><strong>Format:</strong><br>
                <em>"As a [type of user], I want to [perform an action] so that [benefit]."</em></p>
                <p><strong>Real-World Example:</strong><br>
                For the Epic <em>"Develop the Homepage Design,"</em> a User Story might be:<br>
                <em>"As a visitor, I want to see featured products on the homepage so that I can quickly find popular items."</em></p>
                
                <h3>Task</h3>
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A <strong>Task</strong> is an <strong>individual piece of work</strong> needed to complete a User Story. Tasks are actionable items assigned to team members.</p>
                <p><strong>Real-World Example:</strong><br>
                For the User Story above, Tasks could include:
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Design the featured products section layout.</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Select and edit images for featured products.</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Implement the featured products section in Shopify.</strong></li>
                </ol>
                
                <h3>Bug</h3>
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A <strong>Bug</strong> is a <strong>defect or error</strong> in the product that needs to be fixed. Bugs can arise from development issues, design flaws, or user feedback.</p>
                <p><strong>Real-World Example:</strong><br>
                <em>"The featured products section does not display correctly on mobile devices."</em><br>
                This Bug needs to be addressed to ensure a seamless user experience across all devices.</p>

            <!-- Real-World Scenario Tab -->
            <section id="real-world-scenario" class="tab-section">
                <h2>3. Real-World Scenario: Tuff8 Shopify Project</h2>
                <p>Let's walk through how Scrum concepts are applied in a real projectâ€”<strong>building the Tuff8 Shopify website</strong>.</p>
                
                <h3>Defining Epics</h3>
                <p>Start by identifying <strong>big features or goals</strong> for the project. These Epics will guide the overall development.</p>
                <h4>Epics for Tuff8:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Website UI/UX Design</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Product Page Optimization</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Homepage Development</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Custom Features Implementation</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Marketing Strategy Development</strong></li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Creating User Stories</h3>
                <p>Break down each Epic into <strong>User Stories</strong> that describe specific functionalities or requirements from the user's perspective.</p>
                
                <h4>Epic: Website UI/UX Design</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>"As a visitor, I want a clean and modern layout so that I can easily navigate the website."</em></li>
                    <li><em>"As a returning customer, I want to see my recent orders on the dashboard so that I can reorder quickly."</em></li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Epic: Product Page Optimization</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>"As a shopper, I want high-quality images of products so that I can see details before purchasing."</em></li>
                    <li><em>"As a customer, I want detailed product descriptions so that I understand the features and benefits."</em></li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Breaking Down into Tasks</h3>
                <p>For each User Story, define <strong>Tasks</strong> that detail the steps needed to implement the story.</p>
                
                <h4>User Story Example:</h4>
                <p><em>"As a shopper, I want high-quality images of products so that I can see details before purchasing."</em></p>
                
                <h5>Tasks:</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Select Products for High-Quality Images:</strong> Designer 1 selects which products need enhanced images.</li>
                    <li><strong>Edit Product Photos:</strong> Designer 2 edits and optimizes the selected product images for web display.</li>
                    <li><strong>Upload Images to Shopify:</strong> Programmer uploads the edited images to the respective product pages on Shopify.</li>
                    <li><strong>Review and Feedback:</strong> Marketing Manager reviews the images for consistency and quality.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h3>Handling Bugs</h3>
                <p>During the project, you might encounter <strong>Bugs</strong> that need immediate attention to maintain the website's quality.</p>
                
                <h4>Bug Example:</h4>
                <p><em>"The product image gallery is not loading on the product page."</em></p>
                
                <h5>Steps to Resolve:</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Identify the Bug:</strong> A team member notices the issue while testing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Log the Bug:</strong> Create a Bug report detailing the problem.</li>
                    <li><strong>Assign to Programmer:</strong> The Programmer investigates the cause and fixes the image gallery script.</li>
                    <li><strong>Test the Fix:</strong> Ensure the gallery loads correctly on all devices.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>4. Workflow: From Idea to Implementation</h2>
                <p>Understanding how to move from Epics to User Stories, Tasks, and Bugs is crucial. Here's a <strong>step-by-step workflow</strong> using the Tuff8 project.</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Identify Epics:</strong>  
                        <p>Start by listing out major features or goals. For Tuff8, examples include UI/UX Design and Marketing Strategy.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Create User Stories:</strong>  
                        <p>Break down each Epic into smaller User Stories that focus on specific user needs.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Define Tasks:</strong>  
                        <p>For each User Story, list actionable Tasks that need to be completed. Assign these tasks to team members based on their roles.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Plan Sprints:</strong>  
                        <p>Organize Tasks into <strong>Sprints</strong> (typically 2-week cycles). During Sprint Planning, select which User Stories and Tasks to work on.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Daily Standups:</strong>  
                        <p>Hold short daily meetings where each team member shares what they did yesterday, what they're doing today, and any blockers they face.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Sprint Review:</strong>  
                        <p>At the end of each Sprint, demonstrate the completed work to stakeholders and gather feedback.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Sprint Retrospective:</strong>  
                        <p>Reflect on what went well and what could be improved in the next Sprint.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Handle Bugs:</strong>  
                        <p>Address any Bugs that arise promptly to ensure the website remains functional and user-friendly.</p>

                <h2>5. Tips for Creating Great Epics and User Stories</h2>
                <p>Creating effective Epics and User Stories is vital for successful Scrum implementation. Here are some <strong>practical tips</strong>:</p>
                
                <h3>Creating Effective Epics</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Be Clear and Broad:</strong>  
                        <p>Epics should encompass large features without getting bogged down in details. They provide a high-level overview.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Align with Goals:</strong>  
                        <p>Ensure each Epic aligns with the project's overall objectives and delivers significant value.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Limit the Number:</strong>  
                        <p>Avoid having too many Epics. Focus on key areas to maintain clarity and direction.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong>  
                        <p>Instead of having separate Epics for "Design Homepage Layout" and "Design Homepage Navigation," combine them into <em>"Homepage Design."</em></p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Writing Great User Stories</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Use the Standard Format:</strong>  
                        <p><em>"As a [user], I want to [action] so that [benefit]."</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Focus on User Needs:</strong>  
                        <p>Center the story around what the user wants and why, not how to implement it.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Be Specific but Flexible:</strong>  
                        <p>Provide enough detail to understand the requirement without being overly prescriptive.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Prioritize:</strong>  
                        <p>Not all stories are equal. Prioritize based on value and urgency.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong>  
                        <p><em>"As a shopper, I want to filter products by category so that I can find items relevant to my interests quickly."</em></p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Breaking Down Tasks</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Action-Oriented:</strong>  
                        <p>Tasks should start with verbs like "Design," "Develop," "Test," etc.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Small and Manageable:</strong>  
                        <p>Each Task should be achievable within a day or less to maintain momentum.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Clear Ownership:</strong>  
                        <p>Assign each Task to a specific team member to ensure accountability.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Example Tasks for the User Story Above:</strong>  
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Design filter dropdown menu UI:</strong> Designer 1 creates the visual layout for the filter menu.</li>
                            <li><strong>Implement filter functionality in Shopify:</strong> Programmer adds the necessary code to enable filtering by category.</li>
                            <li><strong>Test filter on different devices:</strong> Designer 2 and Programmer collaboratively test the feature on mobile and desktop.</li>
                            <li><strong>Gather feedback from Marketing Manager:</strong> Ensure the filter aligns with marketing strategies and product categorization.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
